# Trillo

## Here is the link to the website: https://briantran140.github.io/Trillo/

### This responsive website is mainly about CSS and HTML, with no Javascript involved. I use mostly flexbox. I use SCSS for this project instead of writing everything in CSS.

### This project is designed by Jonas Schmedtmann. I just rebuilt the whole website to practice my CSS skills.
